# API-Quiz

* This is a multiple choice quiz dealing with Javascript.

# Process

* I started by adding different buttons (start button and answer buttons), and a highscore form directly into the HTML.
* I then began creating global variables and variables for elements I wished to manipulate with my javascript file.
* I made a simple array called questionSet to house all of my questions.
* I then began creating different functions, starting with the startTimer function.
* I then created functions for generating questions and checking the answer.
* After adding event listeners for all buttons, and starting different functions depending on which was clicked, all I had left to do is prompt the user to enter their highscore.
